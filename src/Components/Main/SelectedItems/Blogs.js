                            ReactJS divides the UI into isolated reusable pieces
                            of code known as components. React components work
                            similarly to JavaScript functions as they accept
                            arbitrary inputs called properties or props. It's
                            possible to have as many components as necessary
                            without cluttering your code.

                            Props are used to pass data from one component to
                            another. The state is a local data storage that is
                            local to the component only and cannot be passed to
                            other components. The this.setState property is used
                            to update the state values in the component.

                            It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin
                            adds the appropriate classes that we use to style
                            each element. These classes control the overall
                            appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via
                            CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with
                            custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's
                            also worth noting that just about any HTML can go
                            within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the
                            transition does limit overflow.
